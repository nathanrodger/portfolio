                I have been a Front-end developer for six years, on which I have established a focus for <strong>clean</strong>, <strong>semantic</strong> and <strong>manageable code</strong>. I prefer to work with custom builds over libraries or frameworks to have a full understanding of the codebase and prevent bloat. All the sites that I develop are <strong>responsive</strong>, <strong>cross browser supported</strong> and <strong>accessible</strong>. I am always interested in learning new technologies to elevate my skills.
